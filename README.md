# Genesis ROS Bridge (gs_ros) ü§ñ

`gs_ros` is a ROS 2 package designed to bridge the gap between the powerful [Genesis](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis.git) simulator and the ROS 2 ecosystem. Genesis is a next-generation physics platform for Robotics and Embodied AI, offering:

1.  A universal physics engine built from the ground up for a wide range of materials.
2.  A lightweight, ultra-fast, and user-friendly robotics simulation platform.
3.  A powerful and fast photo-realistic rendering system.
4.  A generative data engine that can create multi-modal data from natural language prompts.

This project provides the essential tools to kickstart your robotics development and simulation within ROS 2 using Genesis.

## ‚ú® Key Features

`gs_ros` is a lightweight, pure Python package that simplifies the integration of Genesis and ROS 2.

-   **ROS 2 Control Integration**: Leverages `topic_based_ros2_control` from PickNikRobotics for seamless compatibility with the `ros2_control` framework.
-   **Simulator Services**: Exposes core simulator functionalities (like pausing, resetting,domain_randomisation,inverse kinematics, forward kinematics, path planning) through ROS 2 services, defined in the accompanying `gs_ros_interfaces` package.
-   **Comprehensive Sensor Suite**: Provides a variety of simulated sensors, publishing data on standard ROS 2 topics.

## üéÆ Supported Sensors

`gs_ros` provides out-of-the-box support for several common robotics sensors:

-   üì∑ **Camera**: Publishes RGB, depth, semantic segmentation, and surface normal images.
-   üì∏ **RGBD Camera**: A convenient wrapper for synchronized RGB and depth image publishing.
-   üõ∞Ô∏è **IMU**: Simulates an Inertial Measurement Unit.
-   üìè **Sectional Lidar**: A 3D Lidar from one camera view.
-   üåê **3D Lidar**: An approximation of a 360 degree 3D Lidar using a ring of 16 evenly spaced cameras.
-   üì° **LaserScan** (In Development)
-   üí• **Contact Sensor** (In Development)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

1.  **ROS 2**: This package is developed for ROS 2. Ensure you have a working installation (e.g., Humble, Iron).
2.  **Genesis Simulator**: Install Genesis by following the instructions in the official [Genesis repository](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis.git).
    > **Note**: `gs_ros` was tested with Genesis `v0.3.1`. Newer versions may have compatibility issues. Please report any problems you encounter!

### Steps

1.  **Downgrade NumPy**
    The default NumPy version installed with Genesis may not be compatible with ROS 2. Downgrade to a compatible version:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy==1.26.4
    ```

2.  **Clone the Repository**
    Navigate to your Colcon workspace's `src` directory and clone this repository.
    ```bash
    # Example for a workspace in ~/ros2_ws
    cd ~/ros2_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/vybhav-ibr/genesis_ros.git
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    Let `rosdep` handle the required dependencies.
    ```bash
    cd ~/ros2_ws
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
    ```

4.  **Build and Source the Workspace**
    Build the package using `colcon`.
    ```bash
    cd ~/ros2_ws
    colcon build
    ```
    > **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter an `ImportError: No module named 'em'`, it might be due to a conflict with a Python virtual environment. Deactivate any active virtual environment and try building with the `--merge-install` flag:
    > `colcon build --merge-install`

    After a successful build, source your workspace's setup file:
    ```bash
    source install/setup.bash
    ```

## üß™ Example Usage

1. **Configure Asset Paths**
    Before launching, you must update the `parent_config.yaml` file to point to the correct paths for your local assets.

2. **Start the genesis Simulator and the gs_ros bridge***

    ```bash
    python test_import.py
    ```

3. **Launch the Ackermann Drive Demo**
    Run the provided demo from the `gs_ros2_control_demos` package to see a wheeled robot in action.

    ```bash
    ros2 launch gs_ros2_control_demos ackermann_drive_example.launch.py
    ```

## üìù Known Issues & Limitations

-   **Genesis Version**: Genesis is under active development. Using the latest version from their `main` branch will likely cause issues. Sticking to a tagged release like `v0.3.1` is recommended.
-   **Parallel Environments**: Support for parallelized simulation environments is not yet implemented but may be added in the future.
-   **Sensor Models**: Currently, no advanced sensor noise or distortion models are included. This is planned for a future release.
-   **3D Lidar Approximation**: The 3D Lidar is not a true ray-based Lidar. It is a resource-intensive approximation created by stitching together data from 16 radially-arranged cameras.
